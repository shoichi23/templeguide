                    Karasuyama Teramachi is located in the Northern Karasuyama from 2nd block through 6th block. Around Teramachi Street, there are as many as 26 temples, each of them has original history. Most of them are moved from different places because of the urbanization of Tokyo or escaping from the Great Kanto Earthquake in 1923.
