                    Kogen-in is dedicated to Amitabha Tathagata. Kogen-in temple (officially Zuisen-san Kogen-in) was built by Arima Yorimoto, the fourth lord of the Kurume domain in 1702. Kogen-in was originally located in Shinagawa but gutted by fire due to the Great Kanto Earthquake in 1923. In 1935, this temple was rebuilt and moved to Karasuyama.

                     Visitors can enjoy seeing the beautiful beauty of Kogen-inâ€™s garden and lake that has Ukimido that is dedicated to Benzaiten. This is also a sightseeing spot for visitors and photographers to take seasonal scenes. In fall, we can see a large number of wild ducks passing the winter at the lake. Also in the lake, carps and turtles swim gracefully.

                    Garden is covered with colorful plants such as azalea, water lily and Japanese clovers.  While walking on the small path through the garden, visitors might forget they are in the urban city.
