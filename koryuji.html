                        Koryu-ji was built in about from 1573 to 1593, as a prayer hall of the Tokugawa family in Edo period. Koryu-ji was originally built in Hamamatsu, then to Ushima, later Asakusa. However, because of the Great Kanto Earthquake in 1935, it was reduced to ashes and rebuilt at Karasuyama in 1927.

                    This temple also has another temple for Kiyomasa Kato, a daimyo of the Azuchi Momoyama and Edo periods. Several historical items related to him are saved in the temple such as a drawing of his going into battle.

                        In Kimigayo, the Japanese national anthem,
                        <blockquote>
                            Rule on, my lord, until what are pebbles now. By ages united to mighty rocks shall grow
                        </blockquote>
                    The pebbles represent the strong bonds no matter how big they are just like the rock at Koryu-temple. It is from Kasuga villege in Gifu prefecture, origin place of the anthem.
