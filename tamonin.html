                        Tamon-in temple is dedicated to Jizo Bodhisattva. Tamon-in temple (officially Kongo-san Higan-ji) was founded in 1628 by Jyutsuyo-shonin, originally located in Tsunohazu village in Western Shinjuku. In 1955, this temple was moved to Karasuyama because of urbanization of Shinjuku. Buddhists of this temple devoted themselves to secure people during the famine in the Tempo period. They noted every victim and gave them Buddhist names.
